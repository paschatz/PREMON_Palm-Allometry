Here you can find the raw data we used for our analysis.

```"palm_allometry.csv"``` contains measurements of <i>P.acuminata</i> measured in January 2020.

## Metadata
- ```Tag``` = Unique tag number for the individual stem. Tag number is the relational variable which we can match with historic data of LDFP.

- ```basal_d``` = diameter at base of stem (cm)

- ```dbh``` = diameter at breast height (cm) 

- ```height``` = stem height (m)

- ```h_dbh``` = height at which dbh was measured (m)

For each of these palms, we measured stem height from the ground to the base of the crown (H<sub>bc</sub>; height of the youngest internode), diameter at 130 cm above ground (D<sub>130</sub>), and basal diameter (D<sub>B</sub>; just above the top of the roots) (Figure S1). For palms with H<sub>bc</sub> â‰¤ 2 m, we measured height with a measuring tape, for palms between 2 and 5 m tall, we used a calibrated extension pole, and for palms > 5 m, we used a Nikon forestry Pro II rangefinder.
